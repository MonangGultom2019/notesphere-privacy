    <h1>Privacy Policy for NoteSphere</h1>
    
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: [INSERT DATE]</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how NoteSphere ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 User Content</h3>
    <p>NoteSphere stores all your notes, drawings, images, and other content locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your content on our servers or any cloud service. Your notes remain private and under your control.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>In the free version of NoteSphere, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device type, operating system version)</li>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>App usage data related to ad interactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is collected by Google AdMob in accordance with their Privacy Policy. We do not have access to personally identifiable information through AdMob.</p>
    
    <h3>1.3 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>We do NOT collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or other personal information</li>
        <li>The content of your notes, drawings, or images</li>
        <li>Your location data</li>
        <li>Contact information from your device</li>
        <li>Any data that can personally identify you</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Local Storage</h3>
    <p>All your notes, drawings, images, and app settings are stored locally on your device using the app's private storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party service.</p>
    
    <h3>2.2 Advertising</h3>
    <p>In the free version, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob uses the information described in section 1.2 to provide relevant ads. You can learn more about how Google uses data for advertising at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Permissions We Request</h2>
    
    <p>NoteSphere requests the following permissions to provide core functionality:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Permission:</strong> Used only when you choose to take a photo directly within the app to add to your notes. We do not access your camera at any other time.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage/Media Permission:</strong> Used only when you choose to select an image from your gallery to add to your notes. We do not access your photos or files at any other time.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Permission:</strong> Required only for displaying advertisements in the free version. Your notes are never transmitted over the internet.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All permissions are optional and requested only when you choose to use features that require them. You can deny these permissions and still use the app for text notes and handwriting.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    
    <p>All your notes and content are stored locally on your device in the app's private directory. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data is not backed up to any cloud service by default</li>
        <li>Your data is not accessible to other apps on your device</li>
        <li>If you uninstall the app, your data will be deleted (unless you have Android backup enabled)</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you have Android's automatic backup feature enabled, your app data may be included in your device backup. This is controlled by your Android system settings, not by our app.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>In the free version of NoteSphere, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob is provided by Google LLC and is subject to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    
    <p>AdMob may use cookies and similar technologies to provide personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your Google account settings or device advertising preferences.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>NoteSphere is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is stored locally on your device and is accessible through the app</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete any note, book, or image at any time through the app. Uninstalling the app will delete all app data</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can control permissions through your device settings</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads through your device settings or Google account settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    
    <p>Your notes and content are stored on your device until you delete them or uninstall the app. We do not retain any copies of your data on our servers because we do not collect or transmit your data.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Pro Version</h2>
    
    <p>The Pro version of NoteSphere does not display advertisements and therefore does not use AdMob or collect any advertising-related information. All other aspects of this Privacy Policy apply to the Pro version as well.</p>
